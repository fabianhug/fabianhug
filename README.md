### ðŸ‘‹ gm gm, I'm Fabian

I'm leading Developer Relations at [Swell Labs](https://github.com/SwellNetwork) and contributing to [ai16z](https://github.com/ai16z)\
When there's some time left, I'm building [devrel.directory](devrel.directory)

I used to have some content written in this intro, but I figured it was all blah blah.

I love researching and building in the field of blockchains, developer relations, AI, and meme culture. I've written some papers and spoken at industry events, but you can check my [portfolio](https://0xfabs.com) or LI for this.

If you're interested in a chat, send me a DM via [X](https://x.com/0xfabs) or [TG](https://t.me/fabianhug)
